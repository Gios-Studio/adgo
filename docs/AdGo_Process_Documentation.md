5. **Latency/Fallback**
   - **Definition:** Ensures ad delivery is robust to network latency, with fallback logic.
   - **Protection Type:** Patent
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Ad delivery never fails due to network issues; fallback is seamless.
   - **Risks & Mitigations:** Increased infra cost; mitigate with caching and edge logic.

6. **Failover/Redundancy**
   - **Definition:** Provides failover for ad delivery and reporting systems.
   - **Protection Type:** Patent
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** No single point of failure; system auto-recovers.
   - **Risks & Mitigations:** Complexity; mitigate with automated failover testing.

7. **Campaign Targeting**
   - **Definition:** Enables targeting by campaign parameters (demographics, interests, etc.).
   - **Protection Type:** Trademark (targeting schema)
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Campaigns reach only defined audience segments.
   - **Risks & Mitigations:** Targeting leakage; mitigate with strict validation.

8. **Multi-Location Support**
   - **Definition:** Allows campaigns to run across multiple locations and regions.
   - **Protection Type:** Copyright
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Campaigns can be configured for any supported region.
   - **Risks & Mitigations:** Location mismatch; mitigate with geo-validation.

9. **A/B Testing**
   - **Definition:** Supports split testing of creatives and campaign parameters.
   - **Protection Type:** Patent
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** A/B test results are statistically valid and actionable.
   - **Risks & Mitigations:** Sample bias; mitigate with randomization.

## Wave 2: Advanced Incentives & Security

10. **Offline Redemption**
    - **Definition:** Allows users to redeem offers without network connectivity.
    - **Protection Type:** Patent
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** Redemption is logged and synced when online.
    - **Risks & Mitigations:** Fraud risk; mitigate with device attestation.

11. **Cross-Platform Deduplication**
    - **Definition:** Prevents duplicate redemptions across devices/platforms.
    - **Protection Type:** Patent
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** No duplicate redemptions detected in logs.
    - **Risks & Mitigations:** Missed duplicates; mitigate with hash-based matching.

12. **Merchant Collusion Detection**
    - **Definition:** Detects and flags collusion between merchants for fraudulent redemptions.
    - **Protection Type:** Patent
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** Collusion events are flagged and reviewed.
    - **Risks & Mitigations:** False positives; mitigate with manual review.

13. **Immutable Ledger**
    - **Definition:** Stores all transactions in an immutable, auditable ledger.
    - **Protection Type:** Patent
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** Ledger entries cannot be altered or deleted.
    - **Risks & Mitigations:** Ledger bloat; mitigate with archiving.

14. **Payout Simulations**
    - **Definition:** Simulates payout scenarios for advertisers and drivers.
    - **Protection Type:** Copyright
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** Simulations match real payout logic.
    - **Risks & Mitigations:** Simulation drift; mitigate with regular sync.

15. **Driver Gamification**
    - **Definition:** Adds gamification elements to driver experience (badges, leaderboards).
    - **Protection Type:** Trademark
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** Drivers see gamification features and respond positively.
    - **Risks & Mitigations:** Over-gamification; mitigate with feedback loops.

16. **Category-Weighted Incentives**
    - **Definition:** Incentives weighted by ad category for drivers and advertisers.
    - **Protection Type:** Patent
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** Incentives are correctly calculated and distributed.
    - **Risks & Mitigations:** Miscalculation; mitigate with automated tests.

## Wave 3: Compliance, SDK, Expansion

17. **Consent Receipts & Audit Logs**
    - **Definition:** Generates consent receipts and audit logs for all user actions.
    - **Protection Type:** Copyright
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** All actions are logged and receipts are available for audit.
    - **Risks & Mitigations:** Log tampering; mitigate with hash chaining.

18. **SDK Attestation & Obfuscation**
    - **Definition:** SDK provides attestation and code obfuscation for security.
    - **Protection Type:** Patent
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** SDK passes attestation checks and is obfuscated.
