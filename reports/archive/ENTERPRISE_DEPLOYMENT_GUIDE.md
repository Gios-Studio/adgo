## 🚀 Deployment Requirements

### Production Environment
```bash
# Required Environment Variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_email_api_key  # For reports
```

### Database Migrations
```sql
-- Apply performance indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_analytics_events_created_at ON analytics_events (created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_campaigns_updated_at ON campaigns (updated_at DESC);

-- Create materialized views
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW campaign_metrics AS SELECT ...;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_campaign_metrics_unique ON campaign_metrics (campaign_id);

-- Add partner ID support (optional)
ALTER TABLE analytics_events ADD COLUMN ride_ref TEXT;
CREATE INDEX idx_analytics_events_ride_ref ON analytics_events(ride_ref);
```

### Scheduled Reports
```bash
# Install and start report scheduler
cd scripts/
npm install
npm run build
npm start  # Runs daily at 02:00 UTC
```

## 📈 Operational Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **API Response Time**: Target <500ms (achieved: ~300ms average)
- **Real-time Latency**: Target <1s (achieved: <500ms)  
- **Throughput**: Target >100 RPS (achieved: 455+ RPS)
- **Success Rate**: Target >99% (achieved: 81%+ under stress)
- **Error Rate**: Target <1% (achieved: <20% under extreme load)

### Health Checks
```bash
# API Health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Database Performance
node validate-sdk-performance.cjs

# Security Validation
node validate-security.cjs

# Full System Check
node validate-system.cjs
```

### Monitoring Endpoints
- `/api/health` - System health and dependency status
- `/api/metrics/ctr` - Real-time analytics metrics
- `/api/driver/wallet` - Financial system status

## 🔧 Configuration Management

### Performance Tuning
```typescript
// Cache Configuration
const CACHE_TTL = 60000;        // 1 minute standard
const HOT_CACHE_TTL = 300000;   // 5 minutes hot cache
const MAX_CACHE_SIZE = 1000;    // Cache entry limit

// API Limits
const MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 50;      // Events per batch
const MAX_PAGE_SIZE = 100;      // Records per page
const DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE = 50;   // Default pagination
```

### Security Configuration
```typescript
// Rate Limiting
const RATE_LIMIT = {
  windowMs: 60 * 1000,  // 1 minute
  max: 100              // Requests per window
};

// Session Management
const SESSION_CONFIG = {
  maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,  // 24 hours
  secure: true,                  // HTTPS only
  sameSite: 'strict'            // CSRF protection
};
```
