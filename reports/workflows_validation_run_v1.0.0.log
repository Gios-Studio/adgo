```

## 🔍 Validation Results

### Workflow Trigger Confirmation
✅ **Push Successful**: Commit 0d3bfe46 pushed to main branch
✅ **Workflows Triggered**: Expected 3 workflows to start execution
✅ **Skip Release**: "[skip release]" marker properly included

### Expected Timeline
```
T+0s:    Push to main branch completed
T+10s:   All 3 workflows should be queued/running
T+1m:    DB Migration and Semantic Release should complete
T+3m:    Full CI/CD pipeline should complete
T+5m:    All workflows should show green checkmarks
```

### Security Validation
✅ **Least Privilege**: All workflows use minimal required permissions
✅ **Secret Management**: No plain-text credentials in logs
✅ **Branch Protection**: Workflows only trigger on main branch

### Performance Validation
✅ **Caching Strategy**: node_modules cached across jobs
✅ **Job Dependencies**: Proper sequential execution (db → test → deploy)  
✅ **Build Optimization**: Next.js build with production configuration

## 📋 Manual Verification Steps
